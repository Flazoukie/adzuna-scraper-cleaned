Welcome to the weekly update of the data science job market in Germany!

This analysis is based on the latest job postings collected via the [Adzuna API](https://developer.adzuna.com/), a comprehensive job search API that aggregates job offers from multiple sources.

All the data fetching, cleaning, and analysis code is publicly available on GitHub in my [\`adzuna-scraper-cleaned\`](https://github.com/Flazoukie/adzuna-scraper-cleaned) repository. This project runs automatically every week to provide fresh insights.

## What you'll find in this post

- A bar plot highlighting the **top cities** with the most data science job offers.
- An **interactive company map** showing where employers are located.
- An **interactive job table** that allows you to explore individual job postings.
